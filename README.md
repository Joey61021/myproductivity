<h1>MyProducivity</h1>
<p>My productivity is an interactive application that helps log and track your daily productivity levels. Each day a user can log their productivity levels from a color metric and enter this into a MySQL database which is later displayed as an overview. This can help people become more productive by recognising their current productivity levels.</p>
